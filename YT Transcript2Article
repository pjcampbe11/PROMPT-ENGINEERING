in the next few lessons I will introduce
0:11
you to the fundamentals of prompt
0:13
engineering through various
0:15
examples we'll start by understanding
0:17
the importance of prompts followed by
0:19
the types of prompts we'll then explore
0:21
a few examples of how to craft these
0:24
prompts I'll also explain what is
0:27
hallucination and how to avoid it
0:29
through prompting engineering finally
0:31
we'll take a closer look at the key
0:33
techniques used in prompt engineering
0:36
let's get started so in this lesson I'm
0:39
going to introduce prompt Engineering in
0:42
generative AI essentially generative AI
What is Prompt Engineering
0:46
turns English into a new programming
0:48
language that's because it's the new
0:51
syntax of generate to
0:53
AI similar to how optimized code
0:56
generates efficient applications
0:58
well-crafted prompts and enable AI
1:00
models to produce accurate
1:03
output so designing a prompt is more of
1:06
an art than
1:08
science prompts influence the models to
1:11
generate the right output without
1:13
explicitly training or fine tuning them
1:16
so fine shuring is a technique that
1:18
we'll explore in the upcoming lessons
1:21
but without explicitly fine-tuning or
1:25
retraining the model you can get what
1:28
you want by by crafting the right prompt
1:31
that is what is called as prompt
1:35
engineering so prompt engineering is the
1:37
practice of carefully designing and
1:39
fine-tuning input prompts to guide an AI
1:42
model's response in a designed
1:45
Direction it can be especially useful
1:47
when dealing with large language models
1:50
like GPT where the quality and nature of
1:52
the output can be significantly
1:54
influenced by the wording and structure
1:57
of your input
1:58
prompt prompt engineering involves both
2:01
an understanding of how the model
2:03
processes the input and a creative
2:06
approach to designing prompts that guide
2:08
the model towards the desired
2:11
output it is often used to fine-tune the
2:14
performance of an AI system without
2:17
really changing the underlying model or
2:19
the training
2:21
data prompt engineering essentially
2:24
influences the model to respond based on
2:27
a specific
2:28
requirement
2:30
lack of prompt engineering leads to
2:32
inaccurate and factually incorrect
2:34
responses which is often called as
2:39
hallucinations so it's important to
2:42
understand
2:43
the significance of prompt Engineering
2:46
in the context of generative AI
2:48
essentially what you ask is what you get
2:51
so the more detailed you are with your
2:54
prompt the more crisp with your prompt
2:58
the better the output is
3:00
so in the coming lessons we'll take a
3:02
closer look at some of the examples
3:05
which will drive the Alm towards
3:07
generating the desired
3:09
output so having understood the
3:11
significance of prompt engineering let's
3:14
take a look at the key types of promts
3:16
that's often used with
Types of Prompts
3:19
llms so there are a variety of
3:22
techniques obviously this section only
3:24
deals with some of the important types
3:27
prompt engineering technically reserves
3:30
an entire course so we're not going to
3:32
go into the details but I'm going to
3:36
cover some of the important aspects and
3:39
types of prompt engineering so as you
3:42
can see there are a variety of prompts
3:45
and we'll take a closer look at each of
Explicit Prompt
3:47
them so there is an explicit prompt
3:51
something like write a short story about
3:53
a young girl who discovers a magical key
3:56
and so on now here if you carefully
3:58
notice we are explicitly asking the llm
4:02
to write a short story and the theme is
4:06
unlocking a hidden door to another world
4:08
so this is being as explicit as possible
4:11
and this basically drives the llm
4:15
towards generating an output that
4:17
matches your desired outcome or the
4:21
expected outcome so the more explicit
4:24
you are the better the output
4:27
is similarly there are conversational
Conversational Prompt
4:30
prompts which you typically ask when
4:33
you're dealing with a chatbot now in
4:35
this case we are actually interacting
4:39
with a chatbot as if we are talking to a
4:42
human so uh can you tell me a funny joke
4:46
about cats now this is a conversational
4:48
prompt and this can continue it can
4:51
actually tell you a joke and you can ask
4:54
something more about it and the
4:55
conversation just goes on and on such
4:58
prompts are called con conversational
5:01
prompts now there are instructional
Instructional Prompts
5:04
prompts which will generate more useful
5:08
content uh something like a blog post
5:12
now in this prompt we are literally
5:15
instructing the llm to write a detailed
5:18
blog
5:19
post discussing the benefits and
5:22
drawbacks of renewable energy and the
5:24
outline should be structured as follows
5:27
and we also Define what are the section
5:29
of this blog post now this is being very
5:32
in instructional or prescriptive with
5:35
your prompt so you are essentially
5:39
handholding the llm and leading it
5:41
towards the outcome that is expected
5:45
that is what is called instructional
5:48
prompt then we have a context based
Context-Based Prompts
5:50
prompt and we will explore this further
5:53
as we go along but context based prompts
5:57
will provide sufficient context text and
6:00
the backstory to the llm before you ask
6:04
a specific question so it's a
6:05
combination of two things one is the
6:07
context the other one is a
6:10
conversational prompt so in this this
6:13
case uh I'm actually asking to suggest
6:16
uh the tourist attractions and local
6:19
restaurants uh based on my plan plan
6:22
trip to Paris next month so if you see I
6:25
have given sufficient context which is
6:29
by plan trip to Paris next month and
6:32
then it is going to uh Come Back to Me
6:36
based on the prompt that follows the
6:38
context so here the context is the trip
6:40
to Paris and the prompt in itself is the
6:43
recommendations about uh restaurants and
6:46
tourist attractions and so on so that is
6:49
context based prompt the more you feed
6:52
in as context the better the llm would
6:55
be so you can even copy paste some
6:58
context from other websites or your
7:02
private data and and this will literally
7:05
help or enable the llm to derive
7:09
additional context now think of it like
7:12
the backstory that you're providing to
7:13
the llm before it answers your
7:16
question then there are open-ended
Open-Ended Prompts
7:19
prompts which
7:20
are very very Broad and they don't
7:23
really have any context they don't have
7:25
any conversational style prompt they are
7:27
very open-ended and they l Force the llm
7:30
to be creative and come back with uh
7:33
typically a pretty large answer so in
7:36
this case we are asking about the impact
7:38
of AI which is a very broad topic and
7:40
notice that we are not adding any
7:43
context and we are not instructing the
7:46
llm we are simply asking a very
7:49
open-ended uh question about the impact
7:53
of AI on society so this is uh a typical
7:57
example of an open and Ed
8:00
prompt
8:02
then there is something called bias
Bias-Mitigating Prompts
8:04
mitigating prompt as you understand llms
8:09
are trained on large corpora which
8:12
includes publicly available data sets
8:15
and obviously the publicly available
8:16
data sets are biased because they are
8:20
ultimately generated by humans and
8:22
humans tend to have biases in their
8:24
thinking and in their writing so when
8:26
you train an llm on the public data
8:29
public that the data that's available in
8:31
the public domain you obviously see
8:34
certain bias So to avoid that you can
8:38
steer the llm towards bias
8:41
mitigation now in this example I am
8:45
picking up a very sensitive topic which
8:47
is cast based reservations in
8:49
India now while I pick this topic as an
8:53
input to the llm I also provide
8:57
additional instruction that says avoid
9:00
favoring any particular group ideology
9:03
or opinion and focus on factual
9:06
information supported by reliable
9:08
sources and
9:10
also strive for inclusivity and fairness
9:13
now this is a pretty detailed prompt and
9:16
it it very clearly instructs the llm to
9:19
stay away from any bias or any opinion
9:24
that is skewed towards a specific group
9:27
ideology opinion or a community so this
9:30
is how you derive a very objective and
9:34
factually correct information from llms
9:38
without letting them hallucinate or
9:41
generate content that is biased so when
9:44
you are crafting a prompt on any any
9:47
topic where you know there are biases
9:50
and there are highly skewed opinions
9:54
this could be one of the ways to avoid
9:57
lm's response being being biased by
10:01
specifically mentioning what to filter
10:03
and what to avoid when you're actually
10:05
generating this so that is Biers
10:08
mitigating prompt now you can actually
10:10
take all of this and try it with chat
10:13
GPT uh the resources section has a PDF
10:17
with all these prompts so feel free to
10:19
copy and paste them in the chat GPT
10:21
window and uh see the responses by
10:24
yourself of course the response might be
10:26
slightly different based on what you see
10:28
on the screen uh because llms respond
10:31
differently they are non- deterministic
10:33
but all these prompts are available to
10:35
you to play with and finally the most
10:38
interesting part of prompt generation or
Code Generation Prompts
10:42
prompt crafting which is code generation
10:45
now llms have been trained on not just
10:49
the textual data that is available in
10:51
the public domain but they're also
10:53
trained on various coding uh Snippets
10:58
and coding reports course so uh
11:01
obviously that makes them capable of
11:04
responding to prompts that deal with
11:07
code now in this example I'm asking GPT
11:12
to write a python function that takes in
11:14
a list of integers as input and Returns
11:17
the sum of all the even numbers in the
11:19
list now this is a slightly complex code
11:23
snippet uh of course it's not very
11:25
complex but for a beginner this requires
11:29
some kind of research and looking up
11:32
docs or looking at stack Overflow Etc
11:35
but uh CH GPT is smart enough to come
11:38
back with the code snippet that you can
11:40
literally copy paste and uh see for
11:43
yourself here it actually creates a
11:45
function called uh def some even numbers
11:50
and then writes the entire logic it also
11:53
creates another code snippet that
11:54
invokes the function with some sample
11:56
data and it also comments what could be
11:59
the potential output so this is a very
12:01
very helpful
12:03
mechanism to generate code that can go
12:06
into your uh your your applications of
12:10
course you got to be slightly cautious
12:12
you got to test this thoroughly before
12:14
you include that in your production code
12:16
but you can definitely Ray on nlms to
12:18
generate code to accelerate your
12:22
programming so to summarize we have seen
12:25
some of the common examples of from
12:29
design which will Ste the llm towards
12:33
delivering the desired output or the
12:35
outcome without hallucination without uh
12:39
uh giving you random answers so so
12:42
that's about the lesson where we have
12:45
seen the
12:47
examples so in this section we have seen
Key Techniques of Prompt Engineering
12:50
various examples and various mechanisms
12:54
of crafting The Prompt but there are
12:56
some well-proven techniques
12:59
that we can use to get the desired
13:01
output from the
13:03
L so in this lesson we'll explore some
13:05
of those key
13:08
techniques now
13:10
essentially when you are crafting a
13:12
prompt it can be one of these three
13:15
techniques there is zero short prompting
13:19
one short prompting or few short
13:22
prompting let's take a closer look at
13:24
each of
13:25
those so zero shot prompting is a
Zero Shot Prompting
13:28
technique that allows an llm to perform
13:31
a task without being explicitly trained
13:34
on that
13:35
task so this is done by providing the
13:38
llm with a prompt that describes the
13:40
task and the llm uses its knowledge of
13:44
the world to generate the response now
13:46
obviously this is based on the
13:47
pre-training DAT data that was used to
13:49
train this
13:51
model for example you could give an llm
13:54
The Prompt write a poem about now and
13:57
the llm would be able to generate a poem
13:58
about La even though it was never
14:00
explicitly trained on the task of
14:03
writing poems this is again derived from
14:05
the pre-training
14:07
data zero shot prompting is made
14:09
possible by the fact that llms are
14:12
trained on massive data sets of text and
14:15
code these data sets contain a wide
14:18
variety of information um including
14:21
information about different tasks and
14:22
how to perform them so this allows llm
14:25
to learn the general principles of how
14:28
to perform in task even if it has never
14:31
seen such a task before so zero short
14:35
prompting is basically asking a direct
14:39
question without any examples or without
14:43
any additional context so these are some
14:46
of the examples translate the sentence
14:48
from English to French summarize this
14:50
article in 100 words answer the
14:52
following question now if you see there
14:54
is no precedence there is no example
14:56
that we are setting or in many cases we
14:59
don't even provide the context but it is
15:01
able to generate the output just based
15:05
on a singular prompt and this is called
15:08
zero short
15:10
prompting now one shot prompting is a
One Shot Prompting
15:14
slightly Advanced
15:16
technique now this allows a large
15:18
language model to perform a task after
15:21
being trained on a single
15:23
example this is done by providing the
15:25
llm with a prompt uh that describes the
15:27
task and llm uses the example to learn
15:30
how to perform the task so you give at
15:33
least one example to the llm and it uses
15:37
that as a reference to finish the output
15:40
so oneshot prompting refers to providing
15:42
a single instruction or a question to an
15:45
AI llm and receiving a coherent and
15:48
complete
15:49
response so oneshot prompting is made
15:52
possible by the fact that llms are able
15:55
to learn from very small amounts of data
15:57
essentially that's the context are the
16:00
examples that you provide uh this is
16:02
because llms are trained on massive data
16:04
sets and they have the ability to look
16:09
at the previous examples and learn from
16:13
them even if they are not completely
16:15
aware of the domain so when an llm is
16:19
given a single
16:20
example it can use the example to learn
16:23
the specific details of how to perform
16:25
the task so onot prompting is a new
16:29
technique it is still evolving but if
16:31
you use it you're going to see a
16:33
significant Improvement in the responses
16:36
so let's take an example of uh a few
16:38
prompts that use oneshot prompting
16:41
technique
16:43
so here you provide a prompt write a
16:47
short story about a detective solving a
16:50
mysterious
16:51
murder so you are giving enough hints
16:55
and you are giving uh certain examples
16:58
that the llm can Leverage What are the
17:02
symptoms and
17:03
treatments uh treatment options for
17:05
seasonal allergies so you know this is
17:08
basically a oneshot prompt where you
17:12
have the instruction plus an example now
17:15
provide a step-by-step guide now that is
17:18
the
17:19
instruction on how to make a classic
17:21
margarita Pisa and and that is a hint or
17:26
a one-hot example of what you want the
17:29
llm to generate so if you see the
17:31
difference between zero shot and one
17:34
shot they basically differ in the way
17:38
the prompt is constructed in one shot
17:41
prompting we have some hint or an
17:44
example that the llm can look up to
17:47
generate the
17:49
response now without that for example if
17:52
we go back and look at zero shot here we
17:58
we don't have any examples or we don't
18:01
have any additional uh context provided
18:05
whereas in one shot prompting we have
18:08
some kind of a hint in the form of an
18:11
example and that's what is actually
18:13
called as
18:14
oneshot so obviously there is one more
18:17
technique which is more powerful and
Few-Shot Prompting
18:20
that is called f shot prompting so few
18:22
short learning is a way of instructing
18:25
llms where the border is given several
18:27
examples
18:29
and expected to understand the task
18:30
based on those examples so here we we
18:34
expand the one shot to include more
18:36
examples and then it obviously becomes a
18:38
few short prompting technique and this
18:40
method is often used to slightly nurge
18:43
the model into understanding the context
18:46
and format of what's
18:48
expected and by providing several
18:50
examples within the prompt we provide uh
18:53
just enough context for the llm to
18:55
derive the pattern once the llm analyz
18:58
The Prompt and understands the pattern
19:00
that is embedded within the prompt it
19:03
continues to generate similar content so
19:05
this is almost pushing or nudging the
19:09
llm a little bit to generate the output
19:12
that we really want uh take a look at
19:15
this example so we describe an animal
19:19
and we give the output of the animal
19:23
itself so for the first two we have a
19:28
explained or or described the animal and
19:30
then we also called out the animal but
19:33
in the third one we describe the
19:36
characteristics of that animal but we
19:38
don't really provide the output and we
19:40
leave it for the llm to
19:42
fill so this is actually a good exercise
19:45
for you again these prompts are
19:47
available in the resources section uh
19:50
you can copy and paste and see the
19:52
output so feel free to copy and paste
19:55
this prompt and see what CH GPT comes
19:57
back with
19:58
so this is called few shot where you are
20:01
providing certain examples and expect
20:04
the llm to fill in the blanks by
20:07
populating the
20:09
out for example if you want to convert a
20:12
few sentences from English to French you
20:16
give the translation through a few
20:19
examples like two or three of them and
20:22
then you give another word and you don't
20:24
give the translation the llm will come
20:26
back and populate that because now we
20:28
knows what the top three examples are
20:31
are providing and it figures out what
20:33
needs to be done with the fourth so that
20:35
is called the few short prompting and
20:37
it's a very powerful technique and I
20:39
strongly encourage you to explore and
20:42
craft your own prompts uh that that have
20:45
the format of zero short one short and
20:48
few short prompting
20:56
techniques

This was a 20 min video and grabbing the transcript took 1 min and then 1 more min to run this prompt.

Understanding Prompt Engineering in Generative AI: A Comprehensive Guide
Prompt engineering has become a cornerstone for effectively harnessing the potential of generative AI systems like GPT. This article unpacks the essentials of prompt engineering, highlighting its significance, techniques, and types to help you get the best results from AI models.

What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing input prompts to guide AI models toward producing accurate and desired outputs. Think of it as crafting instructions in a way that an AI model can understand and act upon, much like writing optimized code to create efficient applications.

Why is Prompt Engineering Important?
Generative AI models, such as GPT, process language in a way that allows them to generate text, code, and other outputs. However, the quality of their responses is largely influenced by the clarity and specificity of the input prompts. Poorly designed prompts can lead to:

Hallucinations: Incorrect or irrelevant outputs.
Bias: Responses skewed due to training data.
Proper prompt engineering mitigates these issues, enabling better accuracy and usability without the need for fine-tuning the underlying model or retraining on specific datasets.

Key Types of Prompts
Prompt engineering encompasses various approaches tailored to specific tasks and outcomes. Below are the major types:

1. Explicit Prompts
Explicit prompts are direct and specific. These prompts leave little room for interpretation, ensuring precise responses from the AI.

Example:

"Write a short story about a young girl who discovers a magical key."
This type of prompt defines the task, theme, and even tone, guiding the AI toward a targeted outcome.
2. Conversational Prompts
Designed for chatbots and interactive AI systems, conversational prompts simulate natural human interaction.

Example:

"Can you tell me a funny joke about cats?"
The AI responds conversationally, continuing the dialogue based on user inputs.
3. Instructional Prompts
Instructional prompts involve detailed and prescriptive inputs, often used for generating structured content like essays or blog posts.

Example:

"Write a detailed blog post discussing the benefits and drawbacks of renewable energy. Use the following structure: Introduction, Benefits, Drawbacks, Conclusion."
4. Context-Based Prompts
Context-based prompts provide additional background information or context before asking the main question, improving the relevance of responses.

Example:

"I’m planning a trip to Paris next month. Can you suggest some tourist attractions and local restaurants?"
5. Open-Ended Prompts
Open-ended prompts encourage creativity and broad responses by not restricting the AI with specifics or context.

Example:

"What is the impact of AI on society?"
6. Bias-Mitigating Prompts
These prompts explicitly instruct the AI to avoid bias and ensure fairness, particularly in sensitive or controversial topics.

Example:

"Discuss caste-based reservations in India. Avoid favoring any particular group or ideology. Focus on factual information and inclusivity."
7. Code Generation Prompts
Code-related prompts leverage AI’s training on programming data to generate functional code snippets.

Example:

"Write a Python function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers."
Advanced Techniques in Prompt Engineering
1. Zero-Shot Prompting
Zero-shot prompting involves asking the AI to perform a task without any prior examples or context. The model relies solely on its training data to generate a response.

Example:

"Translate this sentence from English to French."
2. One-Shot Prompting
In one-shot prompting, a single example is provided to guide the AI, helping it understand the task better.

Example:

Prompt: "Write a short story about a detective solving a mystery. For instance, the story could involve a missing painting."
3. Few-Shot Prompting
Few-shot prompting provides multiple examples to establish a clear pattern, enabling the AI to produce consistent and accurate outputs.

Example:

Examples Provided:
"Translate: Hello (English) → Bonjour (French)."
"Translate: Goodbye (English) → Au revoir (French)."
Prompt: "Translate: Thank you (English) → ?"
